  <div class="small-12 cell">
    <p class="orgnParaMain">1 organ donor can save 8 lives and change the lives of more than 50 people. Donors are needed for all races and ethnic groups. Transplant success rates increase when organs are matched between members of the same ethnic background. Anyone, regardless of age or medical history, can sign up to be a donor.</p>

    <p class="orgnPara">Eyes are one of the most important sensory organs in the human body because it renders vision and the power to see. Visually impaired people feel that their life is incomplete as they can just touch, feel and smell things but can’t see it.Statistics show that there are 15 million blind people in India and out of this, 6.8 million people are suffering from corneal blindness.Donated eyes can be used to restore vision in people who are suffering from corneal blindness. The front, clear and transparent tissue of the eye called as cornea can be used to restore vision in a corneal blind person. The other portions of the eye are also used for research and training purposes to develop cures for some of the common eye diseases.From each pair of donated eyes, two blind people will get vision and light in to their life, thus making it more divine.</p>

    <p class="orgnParaR">When we breathe, we do not often think of the complex process that is necessary to keep oxygen flowing through the body. The lungs are crucial to this, as they pass oxygen into the bloodstream and remove carbon dioxide that is then expelled from the body.While a person can live a normal life with only 30 percent of lung function, there are thousands of people whose lungs have been damaged more significantly, and therefore, need a transplant to survive. Patients on the lung transplant waiting list are often severely disabled and might even require oxygen 24-hours-a-day. Living lung donation is a possibility in some instances, as two living donors can each offer a lobe their lungs, which are then both transplanted into the patient.</p>

    <p class="orgnParaR">The life-center point of the body and the most important organ in the human body, the heart is the most diligent muscle in our bodies, in charge of drawing blood all through the body. Much the same as some other muscle, it can be liable to exhaustion, particularly on the off chance that it has been debilitated by various cardiovascular illnesses. Donation is key to saving the life of a patient who is waiting for a heart transplant as the severity of the weakened heart is critical. The only option, if no transplant is immediately available, is for the patient to be assisted with a mechanical heart called an LVAD (Left Ventricular Assist Device), which can be surgically implanted to maintain blood pumping until a transplant is available.</p>

    <p class="orgnPara">Your liver is the largest organ in your body. It is a vital part of your digestive system, helping the body to get rid of toxins and regulate blood sugar levels. Because the liver supports almost every other organ in your body, even 24 hours without a fully working liver can be life-threatening.Living-donor transplantation involves the removal of a portion of the donor's healthy liver for transplantation into a recipient in need. A family member or someone emotionally close to the recipient may volunteer to donate a portion of their healthy liver. This procedure is made possible by the liver's unique ability to regenerate. After transplantation, the partial livers of both the donor and recipient will grow and remodel to form complete organs.</p>

The kidneys are part of the waste disposal team. About 25% of all blood from the heart goes into the kidneys. The first successful kidney transplant was done by Joseph E. Smith and his team in Boston in 1954. Every human body consists of two kidneys and donating one of them to someone in need is the biggest gift anyone can give.
